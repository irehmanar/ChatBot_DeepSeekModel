# ChatBot_DeepSeekModel
This repo demonstrates LangChain with Streamlit to build an interactive app using the Ollama "deepseek-r1:1.5b" model. It features custom prompts, response parsing, and secure API key management via .env. With LangSmith tracking and a user-friendly UI, itâ€™s ideal for querying LLMs in real-time using dynamic prompts.
